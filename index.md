[Ginkgo](http://github.com/onsi/ginkgo) is a BDD-style Go testing framework built to help you efficiently write expressive and comprehensive tests.  It is best paired with the [Gomega](http://github.com/onsi/gomega) matcher library but is designed to be matcher-agnostic.

These docs are written assuming you'll be using Gomega with Ginkgo.  They also assume you know your way around Go and have a good mental model for how Go organizes packages under `$GOPATH`.

---

## Getting Ginkgo

Just `go get` it:

    $ go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
    $ go get github.com/onsi/gomega/...

This fetches ginkgo and installs the `ginkgo` executable under `$GOPATH/bin` -- you'll want that on your `$PATH`.

**Ginkgo is tested against Go v1.6 and newer**
To install Go, follow the [installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install)

The above commands also install the entire gomega library. If you want to fetch only the packages needed by your tests, import the packages you need and use `go get -t`. 

For example, import the gomega package in your test code:

    import "github.com/onsi/gomega"

Use `go get -t` to retrieve the packages referenced in your test code:

    $ cd /path/to/my/app
    $ go get -t ./...

---

## Getting Started: Writing Your First Test
Ginkgo hooks into Go's existing `testing` infrastructure.  This allows you to run a Ginkgo suite using `go test`.

> This also means that Ginkgo tests can live alongside traditional Go `testing` tests.  Both `go test` and `ginkgo` will run all the tests in your suite.

### Bootstrapping a Suite
To write Ginkgo tests for a package you must first bootstrap a Ginkgo test suite.  Say you have a package named `books`:

    $ cd path/to/books
    $ ginkgo bootstrap

This will generate a file named `books_suite_test.go` containing:

```go
package books_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
    "testing"
)

func TestBooks(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)
    RunSpecs(t, "Books Suite")
}
```

Let's break this down:

- Go allows us to specify the `books_test` package alongside the `books` package.  Using `books_test` instead of `books` allows us to respect the encapsulation of the `books` package: your tests will need to import `books` and access it from the outside, like any other package.  This is preferred to reaching into the package and testing its internals and leads to more behavioral tests.  You can, of course, opt out of this -- just change `package books_test` to `package books`
- We import the `ginkgo` and `gomega` packages into the test's top-level namespace by performing a dot-import.  If you'd rather not do this, check out the [Avoiding Dot Imports](#avoiding-dot-imports) section below.
- `TestBooks` is a `testing` test.  The Go test runner will run this function when you run `go test` or `ginkgo`.
- `RegisterFailHandler(Fail)`: A Ginkgo test signals failure by calling Ginkgo's `Fail(description string)` function.  We pass this function to Gomega using `RegisterFailHandler`.  This is the sole connection point between Ginkgo and Gomega.
- `RunSpecs(t *testing.T, suiteDescription string)` tells Ginkgo to start the test suite.  Ginkgo will automatically fail the `testing.T` if any of your specs fail.

At this point you can run your suite:

    $ ginkgo #or go test

    === RUN TestBootstrap

    Running Suite: Books Suite
    ==========================
    Random Seed: 1378936983

    Will run 0 of 0 specs


    Ran 0 of 0 Specs in 0.000 seconds
    SUCCESS! -- 0 Passed | 0 Failed | 0 Pending | 0 Skipped

    --- PASS: TestBootstrap (0.00 seconds)
    PASS
    ok      books   0.019s

### Adding Specs to a Suite
An empty test suite is not very interesting.  While you can start to add tests directly into `books_suite_test.go` you'll probably prefer to separate your tests into separate files (especially for packages with multiple files).  Let's add a test file for our `book.go` model:

    $ ginkgo generate book

This will generate a file named `book_test.go` containing:

```go
package books_test

import (
    . "/path/to/books"
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

var _ = Describe("Book", func() {

})
```

Let's break this down:

- We import the `ginkgo` and `gomega` packages into the top-level namespace.  While incredibly convenient, this is not - strictly speaking - necessary.  If youd like to avoid this check out the [Avoiding Dot Imports](#avoiding-dot-imports) section below.
- Similarly, we import the `books` package since we are using the special `books_test` package to isolate our tests from our code.  For convenience we import the `books` package into the namespace.  You can opt out of either these decisions by editing the generated test file.
- We add a *top-level* describe container using Ginkgo's `Describe(text string, body func()) bool` function.  The `var _ = ...` trick allows us to evaluate the Describe at the top level without having to wrap it in a `func init() {}`

The function in the `Describe` will contain our specs.  Let's add a few now to test loading books from JSON:

```go
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var (
        longBook  Book
        shortBook Book
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        longBook = Book{
            Title:  "Les Miserables",
            Author: "Victor Hugo",
            Pages:  1488,
        }

        shortBook = Book{
            Title:  "Fox In Socks",
            Author: "Dr. Seuss",
            Pages:  24,
        }
    })

    Describe("Categorizing book length", func() {
        Context("With more than 300 pages", func() {
            It("should be a novel", func() {
                Expect(longBook.CategoryByLength()).To(Equal("NOVEL"))
            })
        })

        Context("With fewer than 300 pages", func() {
            It("should be a short story", func() {
                Expect(shortBook.CategoryByLength()).To(Equal("SHORT STORY"))
            })
        })
    })
})
```

Let's break this down:

- Ginkgo makes extensive use of closures to allow you to build descriptive test suites.
- You should make use of `Describe` and `Context` containers to expressively organize the behavior of your code.
- You can use `BeforeEach` to set up state for your specs.  You use `It` to specify a single spec.
- In order to share state between a `BeforeEach` and an `It` you use closure variables, typically defined at the top of the most relevant `Describe` or `Context` container.
- We use Gomega's `Expect` syntax to make expectations on the `CategoryByLength()` method.

Assuming a `Book` model with this behavior, running the tests will yield:

    $ ginkgo # or go test
    === RUN TestBootstrap

    Running Suite: Books Suite
    ==========================
    Random Seed: 1378938274

    Will run 2 of 2 specs

    ••
    Ran 2 of 2 Specs in 0.000 seconds
    SUCCESS! -- 2 Passed | 0 Failed | 0 Pending | 0 Skipped

    --- PASS: TestBootstrap (0.00 seconds)
    PASS
    ok      books   0.025s

Success!

### Marking Specs as Failed

While you typically want to use a matcher library, like [Gomega](https://github.com/onsi/gomega), to make assertions in your specs, Ginkgo provides a simple, global, `Fail` function that allows you to mark a spec as failed.  Just call:

```go
Fail("Failure reason")
```

and Ginkgo will take care of the rest.

`Fail` (and therefore Gomega, since it uses fail) will record a failure for the current space *and* panic.  This allows Ginkgo to stop the current spec in its tracks - no subsequent assertions (or any code for that matter) will be called.  Ordinarily Ginkgo will rescue this panic itself and move on to the next test.

However, if your test launches a *goroutine* that calls `Fail` (or, equivalently, invokes a failing Gomega assertion), there's no way for Ginkgo to rescue the panic that `Fail` invokes.  This will cause the test suite to panic and no subsequent tests will run.  To get around this you must rescue the panic using `GinkgoRecover`.  Here's an example:

```go
It("panics in a goroutine", func(done Done) {
    go func() {
        defer GinkgoRecover()

        Ω(doSomething()).Should(BeTrue())

        close(done)
    }()
})
```

Now, if `doSomething()` returns false, Gomega will call `Fail` which will panic but the `defer`red `GinkgoRecover()` will recover said panic and prevent the test suite from exploding.

More details about `Fail` and about using matcher libraries other than Gomega can be found in the [Using Other Matcher Libraries](#using-other-matcher-libraries) section.

### Logging Output

Ginkgo provides a globally available `io.Writer` called `GinkgoWriter` that you can write to.  `GinkgoWriter` aggregates input while a test is running and only dumps it to stdout if the test fails.  When running in verbose mode (`ginkgo -v` or `go test -ginkgo.v`) `GinkgoWriter` always immediately redirects its input to stdout.

When a Ginkgo test suite is interrupted (via `^C`) Ginkgo will emit any content written to the `GinkgoWriter`.  This makes it easier to debug stuck tests.  This is particularly useful when paired with `--progress` which instruct Ginkgo to emit notifications to the `GinkgoWriter` as it runs through your `BeforeEach`es, `It`s, `AfterEach`es, etc...

### IDE Support

Ginkgo works best from the command-line, and [`ginkgo watch`](#watching-for-changes) makes it easy to rerun tests on the command line whenever changes are detected.

There are a set of [completions](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo-sublime-completions) available for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) (just use [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/) to install `Ginkgo Completions`) and for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (use the extensions installer and install vscode-ginkgo).

IDE authors can set the `GINKGO_EDITOR_INTEGRATION` environment variable to any non-empty value to enable coverage to be displayed for focused specs. By default, Ginkgo will fail with a non-zero exit code if specs are focused to ensure they do not pass in CI.

---

## Structuring Your Specs

Ginkgo makes it easy to write expressive specs that describe the behavior of your code in an organized manner.  You use `Describe` and `Context` containers to organize your `It` specs and you use `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` to build up and tear down common set up amongst your tests.

### Individual Specs: `It`
You can add a single spec by placing an `It` block within a `Describe` or `Context` container block:

```go
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    It("can be loaded from JSON", func() {
        book := NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)

        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
        Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
        Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
    })
})
```

> `It`s may also be placed at the top-level though this is uncommon.

#### The `Specify` Alias

In order to ensure that your specs read naturally, the `Specify`, `PSpecify`, `XSpecify`, and `FSpecify` blocks are available as aliases to use in situations where the corresponding `It` alternatives do not seem to read as natural language. `Specify` blocks behave identically to `It` blocks and can be used wherever `It` blocks (and `PIt`, `XIt`, and `FIt` blocks) are used.

An example of a good substitution of `Specify` for `It` would be the following:

```go
Describe("The foobar service", func() {
  Context("when calling Foo()", func() {
    Context("when no ID is provided", func() {
      Specify("an ErrNoID error is returned", func() {
      })
    })
  })
})
```

### Extracting Common Setup: `BeforeEach`
You can remove duplication and share common setup across tests using `BeforeEach` blocks:

```go
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var book Book

    BeforeEach(func() {
        book = NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)
    })

    It("can be loaded from JSON", func() {
        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
        Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
        Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
    })

    It("can extract the author's last name", func() {
        Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
    })
})
```

The `BeforeEach` is run before each spec thereby ensuring that each spec has a pristine copy of the state.  Common state is shared using closure variables (`var book Book` in this case).  You can also perform clean up in `AfterEach` blocks.

It is also common to place assertions within `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` blocks.  These assertions can, for example, assert that no errors occured while preparing the state for the spec.

### Organizing Specs With Containers: `Describe` and `Context`

Ginkgo allows you to expressively organize the specs in your suite using `Describe` and `Context` containers:

```go
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var (
        book Book
        err error
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        book, err = NewBookFromJSON(`{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`)
    })

    Describe("loading from JSON", func() {
        Context("when the JSON parses succesfully", func() {
            It("should populate the fields correctly", func() {
                Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
                Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
                Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
            })

            It("should not error", func() {
                Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })

        Context("when the JSON fails to parse", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                book, err = NewBookFromJSON(`{
                    "title":"Les Miserables",
                    "author":"Victor Hugo",
                    "pages":1488oops
                }`)
            })

            It("should return the zero-value for the book", func() {
                Expect(book).To(BeZero())
            })

            It("should error", func() {
                Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })
    })

    Describe("Extracting the author's last name", func() {
        It("should correctly identify and return the last name", func() {
            Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
        })
    })
})
```

You use `Describe` blocks to describe the individual behaviors of your code and `Context` blocks to excercise those behaviors under different circumstances.  In this example we `Describe` loading a book from JSON and specify two `Context`s: when the JSON parses succesfully and when the JSON fails to parse.  Semantic differences aside, the two container types have identical behavior.

When nesting `Describe`/`Context` blocks the `BeforeEach` blocks for all the container nodes surrounding an `It` are run from outermost to innermost when the `It` is executed.  The same is true for `AfterEach` block though they run from innermost to outermost.  Note: the `BeforeEach` and `AfterEach` blocks run for **each** `It` block.  This ensures a pristine state for each spec.

> In general, the only code within a container block should be an `It` block or a `BeforeEach`/`JustBeforeEach`/`AfterEach` block, or closure variable declarations.  It is generally a mistake to make an assertion in a container block.

> It is also a mistake to *initialize* a closure variable in a container block.  If one of your `It`s mutates that variable, subsequent `It`s will receive the mutated value.  This is a case of test pollution and can be hard to track down.  **Always initialize your variables in `BeforeEach` blocks.**

If you'd like to get information, at runtime about the current test, you can use `CurrentGinkgoTestDescription()` from within any `It` or `BeforeEach`/`AfterEach`/`JustBeforeEach` block.  The `CurrentGinkgoTestDescription` returned by this call has a variety of information about the currently running test including the filename, line number, text in the `It` block, and text in the surrounding container blocks.

### Separating Creation and Configuration: `JustBeforeEach`

The above example illustrates a common antipattern in BDD-style testing.  Our top level `BeforeEach` creates a new book using valid JSON, but a lower level `Context` excercises the case where a book is created with *invalid* JSON.  This causes us to recreate and override the original book.  Thankfully, with Ginkgo's `JustBeforeEach` blocks, this code duplication is unnecessary.

`JustBeforeEach` blocks are guaranteed to be run *after* all the `BeforeEach` blocks have run and *just before* the `It` block has run.  We can use this fact to clean up the Book specs:

```go
var _ = Describe("Book", func() {
    var (
        book Book
        err error
        json string
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        json = `{
            "title":"Les Miserables",
            "author":"Victor Hugo",
            "pages":1488
        }`
    })

    JustBeforeEach(func() {
        book, err = NewBookFromJSON(json)
    })

    Describe("loading from JSON", func() {
        Context("when the JSON parses succesfully", func() {
            It("should populate the fields correctly", func() {
                Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))
                Expect(book.Author).To(Equal("Victor Hugo"))
                Expect(book.Pages).To(Equal(1488))
            })

            It("should not error", func() {
                Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })

        Context("when the JSON fails to parse", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                json = `{
                    "title":"Les Miserables",
                    "author":"Victor Hugo",
                    "pages":1488oops
                }`
            })

            It("should return the zero-value for the book", func() {
                Expect(book).To(BeZero())
            })

            It("should error", func() {
                Expect(err).To(HaveOccurred())
            })
        })
    })

    Describe("Extracting the author's last name", func() {
        It("should correctly identify and return the last name", func() {
            Expect(book.AuthorLastName()).To(Equal("Hugo"))
        })
    })
})
```

Now the actual book creation only occurs once for every `It`, and the failing JSON context can simply assign invalid json to the `json` variable in a `BeforeEach`.

Abstractly, `JustBeforeEach` allows you to decouple **creation** from **configuration**.  Creation occurs in the `JustBeforeEach` using configuration specified and modified by a chain of `BeforeEach`s.

> You can have multiple `JustBeforeEach`es at different levels of nesting.  Ginkgo will first run all the `BeforeEach`es from the outside in, then it will run the `JustBeforeEach`es from the outside in.  While powerful, this can lead to confusing test suites -- so use nested `JustBeforeEach`es judiciously.
>
> Some parting words: `JustBeforeEach` is a powerful tool that can be easily abused.  Use it well.

### Global Setup and Teardown: `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite`

Sometimes you want to run some set up code once before the entire test suite and some clean up code once after the entire test suite.  For example, perhaps you need to spin up and tear down an external database.

Ginkgo provides `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` to accomplish this.  You typically define these at the top-level in the bootstrap file.  For example, say you need to set up an external database:

```go
package books_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"

    "your/db"

    "testing"
)

var dbRunner *db.Runner
var dbClient *db.Client

func TestBooks(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)

    RunSpecs(t, "Books Suite")
}

var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {
    dbRunner = db.NewRunner()
    err := dbRunner.Start()
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

    dbClient = db.NewClient()
    err = dbClient.Connect(dbRunner.Address())
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
})

var _ = AfterSuite(func() {
    dbClient.Cleanup()
    dbRunner.Stop()
})
```

The `BeforeSuite` function is run before any specs are run.  If a failure occurs in the `BeforeSuite` then none of the specs are run and the test suite ends.

The `AfterSuite` function is run after all the specs have run, regardless of whether any tests have failed.  Since the `AfterSuite` typically includes code to clean up persistent state ginkgo will *also* run `AfterSuite` when you send the running test suite an interrupt signal (`^C`).  To abort the `AfterSuite` send another interrupt signal.

Both `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` can be run asynchronously by passing a function that takes a `Done` parameter.

You are only allowed to define `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` *once* in a test suite (you shouldn't need more than one!)

Finally, when running in parallel, each parallel process will run `BeforeSuite` and `AfterSuite` functions.  [Look here](#parallel-specs) for more on running tests in parallel.

### Documenting Complex `It`s: `By`

As a rule, you should try to keep your `It`s, `BeforeEach`es, etc. short and to the point.  Sometimes this is not possible, particularly when testing complex workflows in integration-style tests.  In these cases your test blocks begin to hide a narrative that is hard to glean by looking at code alone.  Ginkgo provides `by` to help in these situations.  Here's a hokey example:

```go
var _ = Describe("Browsing the library", func() {
    BeforeEach(func() {
        By("Fetching a token and logging in")

        authToken, err := authClient.GetToken("gopher", "literati")
        Exepect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

        err := libraryClient.Login(authToken)
        Exepect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
    })

    It("should be a pleasant experience", func() {
        By("Entering an aisle")

        aisle, err := libraryClient.EnterAisle()
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

        By("Browsing for books")

        books, err := aisle.GetBooks()
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        Expect(books).To(HaveLen(7))

        By("Finding a particular book")

        book, err := books.FindByTitle("Les Miserables")
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        Expect(book.Title).To(Equal("Les Miserables"))

        By("Check the book out")

        err := libraryClient.CheckOut(book)
        Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
        books, err := aisle.GetBooks()
        Expect(books).To(HaveLen(6))
        Expect(books).NotTo(ContainElement(book))
    })
})
```

The string passed to `By` is emitted via the [`GinkgoWriter`](#logging-output).  If a test succeeds you won't see any output beyond Ginkgo's green dot.  If a test fails, however, you will see each step printed out up to the step immediately preceding the failure.  Running with `ginkgo -v` always emits all steps.

`By` takes an optional function of type `func()`.  When passed such a function `By` will immediately call the function.  This allows you to organize your `It`s into groups of steps but is purely optional.  In practice the fact that each `By` function is a separate callback limits the usefulness of this approach.

---

## The Spec Runner

### Pending Specs

You can mark an individual spec or container as Pending.  This will prevent the spec (or specs within the container) from running.  You do this by adding a `P` or an `X` in front of your `Describe`, `Context`, `It`, and `Measure`:

```go
PDescribe("some behavior", func() { ... })
PContext("some scenario", func() { ... })
PIt("some assertion")
PMeasure("some measurement")

XDescribe("some behavior", func() { ... })
XContext("some scenario", func() { ... })
XIt("some assertion")
XMeasure("some measurement")
```

> You don't need to remove the `func() { ... }` when you mark an `It` or `Measure` as pending.  Ginkgo will happily ignore any arguments after the string.

> By default, Ginkgo will print out a description for each pending spec.  You can suppress this by setting the `--noisyPendings=false` flag.

Using the `P` and `X` prefixes marks specs as pending at compile time.  If you need to skip a spec at *runtime* (perhaps due to a constraint that can only be known at runtime) you may call `Skip` in your test:

```go
It("should do something, if it can", func() {
    if !someCondition {
        Skip("special condition wasn't met")
    }

    // assertions go here
})
```

> By default, Ginkgo will print out a description for each skipped spec.  You can suppress this by setting the `--noisySkippings=false` flag.

Note that `Skip(...)` causes the closure to exit so there is no need to return.

### Focused Specs

It is often convenient, when developing to be able to run a subset of specs.  Ginkgo has two mechanisms for allowing you to focus specs:

1. You can focus individual specs or whole containers of specs *programatically* by adding an `F` in front of your `Describe`, `Context`, and `It`:
    ```go
    FDescribe("some behavior", func() { ... })
    FContext("some scenario", func() { ... })
    FIt("some assertion", func() { ... })
    ```

    doing so instructs Ginkgo to only run those specs.  To run all specs, you'll need to go back and remove all the `F`s.

2. You can pass in a regular expression with the `--focus=REGEXP` and/or `--skip=REGEXP` flags.  Ginkgo will only run specs that match the focus regular expression and don't match the skip regular expression.

3. In cases where specs dont provide enough hierarchichal distinction between groups of tests, directories can be included in the matching of `focus` and `skip`, via the `--regexScansFilePath` option.  That is, if the original code location for a test is `test/a/b/c/my_test.go`, one can combine `--focus=/b/` along with `--regexScansFilePath=true` to focus on tests including the path `/b/`.  This feature is useful for filtering tests in binary artifacts along the lines of the original directory where those tests were created - but ideally your specs should be organized in such a way as to minimize the need for using this feature.

When Ginkgo detects that a passing test suite has a programmatically focused test it causes the suite to exit with a non-zero status code.  This is to help detect erroneously committed focused tests on CI systems.  When passed a command-line focus/skip flag Ginkgo exits with status code 0 - if you want to focus tests on your CI system you should explicitly pass in a -focus or -skip flag.

Nested programmatically focused specs follow a simple rule: if a leaf-node is marked focused, any of its ancestor nodes that are marked focus will be unfocused.  With this rule, sibling leaf nodes (regardless of relative-depth) that are focused will run regardless of the focus of a shared ancestor; and non-focused siblings will not run regardless of the focus of the shared ancestor or the relative depths of the siblings.  More simply:

```go
FDescribe("outer describe", func() {
    It("A", func() { ... })
    It("B", func() { ... })
})
```

will run both `It`s but

```go
FDescribe("outer describe", func() {
    It("A", func() { ... })
    FIt("B", func() { ... })
})
```

will only run `B`.  This behavior tends to map more closely to what the developer actually intends when iterating on a test suite.

> The programatic approach and the `--focus=REGEXP`/`--skip=REGEXP` approach are mutually exclusive.  Using the command line flags will override the programmatic focus.

> Focusing a container with no `It` or `Measure` leaf nodes has no effect.  Since there is nothing to run in the container, Ginkgo effectively ignores it.

> When using the command line flags you can specify one or both of `--focus` and `--skip`.  If both are specified the constraints will be `AND`ed together.

> You can unfocus programatically focused tests by running `ginkgo unfocus`.  This will strip the `F`s off of any `FDescribe`, `FContext`, and `FIt`s that your tests in the current directory may have.

> If you want to skip entire packages (when running `ginkgo` recursively with the `-r` flag) you can pass a comma-separated list  to `--skipPackage=PACKAGES,TO,SKIP`.  Any packages with *paths* that contain one of the entries in this comma separated list will be skipped.

### Spec Permutation

By default, Ginkgo will randomize the order in which your specs are run.  This can help suss out test pollution early on in a suite's development.

Ginkgo's default behavior is to only permute the order of top-level containers -- the specs *within* those containers continue to run in the order in which they are specified in the test file.  This is helpful when developing specs as it mitigates the coginitive overload of having specs continuously change the order in which they run.

To randomize *all* specs in a suite, you can pass the `--randomizeAllSpecs` flag.  This is useful on CI and can greatly help fight the scourge of test pollution.

Ginkgo uses the current time to seed the randomization.  It prints out the seed near the beginning of the test output.  If you notice test intermittent test failures that you think may be due to test pollution, you can use the seed from a failing suite to exactly reproduce the spec order for that suite.  To do this pass the `--seed=SEED` flag.

When running multiple spec suites Ginkgo defaults to running the suites in the order they would be listed on the file-system.  You can permute the suites by passing `ginkgo --randomizeSuites`

### Parallel Specs

Ginkgo has support for running specs in parallel.  It does this by spawning separate `go test` processes and serving specs to each process off of a shared queue.  This is important for a BDD test framework, as the shared context of the closures does not parallelize well in-process.

To run a Ginkgo suite in parallel you *must* use the `ginkgo` CLI.  Simply pass in the `-p` flag:

    ginkgo -p

this will automatically detect the optimal number of test nodes to spawn (see the note below).

To specify the number of nodes to spawn, use `-nodes`:

    ginkgo -nodes=N

> You do not need to specify both `-p` and `-nodes`.  Setting `-nodes` to anything greater than 1 implies a parallelized test run.

> The number of nodes used with `-p` is `runtime.NumCPU()` if `runtime.NumCPU() <= 4`, otherwise it is `runtime.NumCPU() - 1` based on a rigorous science based heuristic best characterized as "my gut sense based on a few months of experience"

The test runner collates output from the running processes into one coherent output.  This is done, under the hood, via a client-server model: as each client suite completes a test, the test output and status is sent to the server which then prints to screen.  This collates the output of simultaneous test runners to one coherent (i.e. non-interleaved), aggregated, output.

It is sometimes necessary/preferable to view the output of the individual parallel test suites in real-time.  To do this you can set `-stream`:

    ginkgo -nodes=N -stream

When run with the `-stream` flag the test runner simply pipes the output from each individual node as it runs (it prepends each line of output with the node # that the output came from).  This results in less coherent output (lines from different nodes will be interleaved) but can be valuable when debugging flakey/hanging test suites.

> On windows, parallel tests default to `-stream` because Ginkgo can't capture logging to stdout/stderr (necessary for aggregation) on windows.

#### Managing External Processes in Parallel Test Suites

If your tests spin up or connect to external processes you'll need to make sure that those connections are safe in a parallel context.  One way to ensure this would be, for example, to spin up a separate instance of an external resource for each Ginkgo process.  For example, let's say your tests spin up and hit a database.  You could bring up a different database server bound to a different port for each of your parallel processes:

```go
package books_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
    "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/config"

    "your/db"

    "testing"
)

var dbRunner *db.Runner
var dbClient *db.Client


func TestBooks(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)

    RunSpecs(t, "Books Suite")
}

var _ = BeforeSuite(func() {
    port := 4000 + config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelNode

    dbRunner = db.NewRunner()
    err := dbRunner.Start(port)
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

    dbClient = db.NewClient()
    err = dbClient.Connect(dbRunner.Address())
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
})

var _ = AfterSuite(func() {
    dbClient.Cleanup()
    dbRunner.Stop()
})
```


The `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/config` package provides your suite with access to the command line configuration parameters passed into Ginkgo.  The `config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelNode` parameter is the index for the current node (starts with `1`, goes up to `N`).  Similarly `config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelTotal` is the total number of nodes running in parallel.

#### Managing *Singleton* External Processes in Parallel Test Suites

When possible, you should make every effort to start up a new instance of an external resource for every parallel node.  This helps avoid test-pollution by strictly separating each parallel node.

Sometimes (rarely) this is not possible.  Perhaps, for reasons beyond your control, you can only start one instance of a service on your machine.  Ginkgo provides a workaround for this with `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` and `SynchronizedAfterSuite`.

The idea here is simple.  With `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` Ginkgo gives you a way to run some preliminary setup code on just one parallel node (Node 1) and other setup code on all nodes.  Ginkgo synchronizes these functions and guarantees that node 1 will complete its preliminary setup before the other nodes run their setup code.  Moreover, Ginkgo makes it possible for the preliminary setup code on the first node to pass information on to the setup code on the other nodes.

Here's what our earlier database example looks like using `SynchronizedBeforeSuite`:

```go
var _ = SynchronizedBeforeSuite(func() []byte {
    port := 4000 + config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelNode

    dbRunner = db.NewRunner()
    err := dbRunner.Start(port)
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())

    return []byte(dbRunner.Address())
}, func(data []byte) {
    dbAddress := string(data)

    dbClient = db.NewClient()
    err = dbClient.Connect(dbAddress)
    Expect(err).NotTo(HaveOccurred())
})
```

`SynchronizedBeforeSuite` must be passed two functions.  The first must return `[]byte` and the second must accept `[]byte`.  When running with multiple nodes the *first* function is only run on node 1.  When this function completes, all nodes (including node 1) proceed to run the *second* function and will receive the data returned by the first function.  In this example, we use this data-passing mechanism to forward the database's address (set up on node 1) to all nodes.

To clean up correctly, you should use `SynchronizedAfterSuite`.  Continuing our example:

```go
var _ = SynchronizedAfterSuite(func() {
    dbClient.Cleanup()
}, func() {
    dbRunner.Stop()
})
```

With `SynchronizedAfterSuite` the *first* function is run on *all* nodes (including node 1).  The *second* function is only run on node 1.  Moreover, the second function is only run when all other nodes have finished running.  This is important, since node 1 is responsible for setting up and tearing down the singleton resources it must wait for the other nodes to end before tearing down the resources they depend on.

Finally, all of these function can be passed an additional `Done` parameter to run asynchronously.  When running asynchronously, an optional timeout can be provided as a third parameter to `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` and `SynchronizedAfterSuite`.  The same timeout is applied to both functions.

> Note an important subtelty:  The `dbRunner` variable is *only* populated on Node 1.  No other node should attempt to touch the data in that variable (it will be nil on the other nodes).  The `dbClient` variable, which is populated in the second `SynchronizedBeforeSuite` function is, of course, available across all nodes.

---

## Asynchronous Tests

Go does concurrency well.  Ginkgo provides support for testing asynchronicity effectively.

Consider this example:

```go
It("should post to the channel, eventually", func() {
    c := make(chan string, 0)

    go DoSomething(c)
    Expect(<-c).To(ContainSubstring("Done!"))
})
```
This test will block until a response is received over the channel `c`.  A deadlock or timeout is a common failure mode for tests like this, a common pattern in such situations is to add a select statement at the bottom of the function and include a `<-time.After(X)` channel to specify a timeout.

Ginkgo has this pattern built in.  The `body` functions in all non-container blocks (`It`s, `BeforeEach`es, `AfterEach`es, `JustBeforeEach`es, and `Benchmark`s) can take an optional `done Done` argument:

```go
It("should post to the channel, eventually", func(done Done) {
    c := make(chan string, 0)

    go DoSomething(c)
    Expect(<-c).To(ContainSubstring("Done!"))
    close(done)
}, 0.2)
```

`Done` is a `chan interface{}`.  When Ginkgo detects that the `done Done` argument has been requested it runs the `body` function as a goroutine, wrapping it with the necessary logic to apply a timeout assertion.  You must either close the `done` channel, or send something (anything) to it to tell Ginkgo that your test has ended.  If your test doesn't end after a timeout period, Ginkgo will fail the test and move on the next one.

The default timeout is 1 second. You can modify this timeout by passing a `float64` (in seconds) after the `body` function.  In this example we set the timeout to 0.2 seconds.

> Gomega has additional support for making rich assertions on asynchronous code.  Make sure to check out how `Eventually` works in Gomega.

## The Ginkgo CLI

The Ginkgo CLI can be installed by running

    $ go install github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo

It offers a number of conveniences beyond what `go test` provides out of the box and is recommended, but not necessary.

### Running Tests

To run the suite in the current directory, simply run:

    $ ginkgo #or go test

To run the suites in other directories, simply run:

    $ ginkgo /path/to/package /path/to/other/package ...

To pass arguments/custom flags down to your test suite:

    $ ginkgo -- <PASS-THROUGHS>

Note: the `--` is important!  Only arguments following `--` will be passed to your suite. To parse arguments/custom flags in your test suite, declare a variable and initialize it at the package-level:

```go
var myFlag string
func init() {
    flag.StringVar(&myFlag, "myFlag", "defaultvalue", "myFlag is used to control my behavior")
}
```

Of course, ginkgo takes a number of flags.  These must be specified *before* you specify the packages to run.  Here's a summary of the call syntax:

    $ ginkgo <FLAGS> <PACKAGES> -- <PASS-THROUGHS>

Here are the flags that Ginkgo accepts:

**Controlling which test suites run:**

- `-r`

    Set `-r` to have the `ginkgo` CLI recursively run all test suites under the target directories.  Useful for running all the tests across all your packages.

- `-skipPackage=PACKAGES,TO,SKIP`

    When running with `-r` you can pass `-skipPackage` a comma-separated list of entries.  Any packages with *paths* that contain one of the entries in this comma separated list will be skipped.

**Running in parallel:**

- `-p`

    Set `-p` to parallelize the test suite across an auto-detected number of nodes.

- `--nodes=NODE_TOTAL`

    Use this to parallelize the suite across NODE_TOTAL processes.  You don't need to specify `-p` as well (though you can!)

- `-stream`

    By default, when parallelizing a suite, the test runner aggregates data from each parallel node and produces coherent output as the tests run.  Setting `stream` to `true` will, instead, stream output from all parallel nodes in real-time, prepending each log line with the node # that emitted it.  This leads to incoherent (interleaved) output, but is useful when debugging flakey/hanging test suites.

**Modifying output:**

- `--noColor`

    If provided, Ginkgo's default reporter will not print out in color.

- `--succinct`

    Succinct silences much of Ginkgo's more verbose output.  Test suites that succeed basically get printed out on just one line!  Succinct is turned off, by default, when running tests for one package.  It is turned on by default when Ginkgo runs multiple test packages.

- `--v`

    If present, Ginkgo's default reporter will print out the text and location for each spec before running it.  Also, the GinkgoWriter will flush its output to stdout in realtime.

- `--noisyPendings=false`

    By default, Ginkgo's default reporter will provide detailed output for pending specs.  You can set --noisyPendings=false to suppress this behavior.

- `--noisySkippings=false`

    By default, Ginkgo's default reporter will provide detailed output for skipped specs.  You can set --noisySkippings=false to suppress this behavior.

- `--trace`

    If present, Ginkgo will print out full stack traces for each failure, not just the line number at which the failure occurs.

- `--progress`

    If present, Ginkgo will emit the progress to the `GinkgoWriter` as it enters and runs each `BeforeEach`, `AfterEach`, `It`, etc... node.  This is useful for debugging stuck tests (e.g. where exactly is the test getting stuck?) and for making tests that emit many logs to the `GinkgoWriter` more readable (e.g. which logs were emitted in the `BeforeEach`?  Which were emitted by the `It`?).  Combine with `--v` to emit the `--progress` output to stdout.

**Controlling randomization:**

- `--seed=SEED`

    The random seed to use when permuting the specs.

- `--randomizeAllSpecs`

    If present, all specs will be permuted.  By default Ginkgo will only permute the order of the top level containers.

- `--randomizeSuites`

    If present and running multiple spec suites, the order in which the specs run will be randomized.

**Focusing and Skipping specs:**

- `--skipMeasurements`

    If present, Ginkgo will skip any `Measure` specs you've defined.

- `--focus=REGEXP`

    If provided, Ginkgo will only run specs with descriptions that match the regular expression REGEXP.

- `--skip=REGEXP`

    If provided, Ginkgo will only run specs with descriptions that do not match the regular expression REGEXP.

**Running the race detector and code coverage tools:**

- `-race`

    Set `-race` to have the `ginkgo` CLI run your tests with the race detector on.

- `-cover`

    Set `-cover` to have the `ginkgo` CLI run your tests with coverage analysis turned on (a Go 1.2+ feature).  Ginkgo will generate coverage profiles under the current directory named `PACKAGE.coverprofile` for each set of package tests that is run.

- `-coverpkg=<PKG1>,<PKG2>`

    Like `-cover`, `-coverpkg` runs your tests with coverage analysis turned on.  However, `-coverpkg` allows you to specify the packages to run the analysis on.  This allows you to get coverage on packages outside of the current package, which is useful for integration tests.  Note that it will not run coverage on the current package by default, you always need to specify all packages you want coverage for.
    The package name should be fully resolved, eg `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/reporters/stenographer`

- `-coverprofile=<FILENAME>`

    Renames coverage results file to a provided filename
    
- `-outputdir=<DIRECTORY>`
   
    Moves coverage results to a specified directory <br />
    When combined with `-coverprofile` will also append them together
    
**Build flags:**

- `-tags`

    Set `-tags` to pass in build tags down to the compilation step.

- `-compilers`

    When compiling multiple test suites (e.g. with `ginkgo -r`) Ginkgo will use `runtime.NumCPU()` to determine the number of compile processes to spin up.  On some environments this is a bad idea.  You can specify th enumber of compilers manually with this flag.

**Failure behavior:**

- `--failOnPending`

    If present, Ginkgo will mark a test suite as failed if it has any pending specs.

- `--failFast`

    If present, Ginkgo will stop the suite right after the first spec failure.

**Watch flags:**

- `--depth=DEPTH`

    When watching packages, Ginkgo also watches those package's dependencies for changes.  The default value for `--depth` is `1` meaning that only the immediate dependencies of a package are monitored.  You can adjust this up to monitor dependencies-of-dependencies, or set it to `0` to only monitor the package itself, not its dependencies.

- `--watchRegExp=WATCH_REG_EXP`

    When watching packages, Ginkgo only monitors files matching the watch regular expression for changes.  The default value is `\.go$` meaning only go files are watched for changes.

**Flaky test mitigation:**

- `--flakeAttempts=ATTEMPTS`

    If a test fails, Gingko can rerun it immediately. Set this flag to a value
    greater than 1 to enable retries. As long as one of the retries succeeds,
    Ginkgo will not consider the test suite to have been failed. The individual
    failed runs will still be reported in the output; the JUnit output, for
    example, will claim 0 failures (since the suite passed) but will still
    contain any failing runs for a test that both passed and failed.

    This flag is dangerous! Don't be tempted to use it to cover up bad tests!

**Miscellaneous:**

- `-dryRun`

    If present, Ginkgo will walk your test suite and report output *without* actually running your tests.  This is best paried with `-v` to preview which tests will run.  Ther ordering of the tests honors the randomization strategy specified by `--seed` and `--randomizeAllSpecs`.

- `-keepGoing`

    By default, when running multiple tests (with -r or a list of packages) Ginkgo will abort when a test fails.  To have Ginkgo run subsequent test suites after a failure you can set -keepGoing.

- `-untilItFails`

    If set to `true`, Ginkgo will keep running your tests until a failure occurs.  This can be useful to help suss out race conditions or flakey tests.  It's best to run this with `--randomizeAllSpecs` and `--randomizeSuites` to permute test order between iterations.

- `-notify`

    Set `-notify` to receive desktop notifications when a test suite completes.  This is especially useful with the `watch` subcommand.  Currently `-notify` is only supported on OS X and Linux.  On OS X you'll need to `brew install terminal-notifier` to receive notifications, on Linux you'll need to download and install `notify-send`.

- `--slowSpecThreshold=TIME_IN_SECONDS`

    By default, Ginkgo's default reporter will flag tests that take longer than 5 seconds to run -- this does not fail the suite, it simply notifies you of slow running specs.  You can change this threshold using this flag.

- `-timeout=DURATION`

    Ginkgo will fail the test suite if it takes longer than `DURATION` to run.  The default value is 24 hours.

- `--afterSuiteHook=HOOK_COMMAND`

    Ginko has the ability to run a command hook after a suite test completes.  You simply give it the command to run and it will do string replacement to pass data into the command.  Example: --afterSuiteHook=”echo  (ginkgo-suite-name) suite tests have [(ginkgo-suite-passed)]”  This suite hook will replace (ginkgo-suite-name) and (ginkgo-suite-passed) with the suite name and pass/fail status respectively, then echo that to the terminal.

- `-requireSuite`

    If you create a package with Ginkgo test files, but forget to run `ginkgo bootstrap` your tests will never run and the suite will always pass. Ginkgo does notify with the message `Found no test suites, did you forget to run "ginkgo bootstrap"?` but doesn't fail. This flag causes Ginkgo to mark the suite as failed if there are test files but nothing that references `RunSpecs.`

### Watching For Changes

The Ginkgo CLI provides a `watch` subcommand that takes (almost) all the flags that the main `ginkgo` command takes.  With `ginkgo watch` ginkgo will monitor the package in the current directory and trigger tests when changes are detected.

You can also run `ginkgo watch -r` to monitor all packages recursively.

For each monitored packaged, Ginkgo will also monitor that package's dependencies and trigger the monitored package's test suite when a change in a dependency is detected.  By default, `ginkgo watch` monitors a package's immediate dependencies.  You can adjust this using the `-depth` flag.  Set `-depth` to `0` to disable monitoring dependencies and set `-depth` to something greater than `1` to monitor deeper down the dependency graph.

Passing the `-notify` flag on Linux or OS X will trigger desktop notifications when `ginkgo watch` triggers and completes a test run.

### Precompiling Tests

Ginkgo has strong support for writing integration-style acceptance tests.  These tests are useful tools to validate that (for example) a complex distributed system is functioning correctly.  It is often convenient to distribute these acceptance tests as standalone binaries.

Ginkgo allows you to build such binaries with:

    ginkgo build path/to/package

This will produce a precompiled binary called `package.test`.  You can then invoke `package.test` directly to run the test suite.  Under the hood `ginkgo` is simply calling `go test -c -o` to compile the `package.test` binary.

Calling `package.test` directly will run the tests in *series*.  To run the tests in parallel you'll need the `ginkgo` cli to orchestrate the parallel nodes.  You can run:

    ginkgo -p path/to/package.test

to do this.  Since the ginkgo CLI is a single binary you can provide a parallelizable (and therefore *fast*) set of integration-style acceptance tests simply by distributing two binaries.

> The `build` subcommand accepts a subset of the flags that `ginkgo` and `ginkgo watch` take.  These flags are constrained to compile-time concerns such as `--cover` and `--race`.  You can learn more via `ginkgo help build`.

> You can cross-compile and target different platforms using the standard `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables.  So `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ginkgo build path/to/package` run on OS X will create a `package.test` binary that runs on linux.

### Generators

- To bootstrap a Ginkgo test suite for the package in the current directory, run:

        $ ginkgo bootstrap

    This will generate a file named `PACKAGE_suite_test.go` where PACKAGE is the name of the current directory.

- To add a test file to a package, run:

        $ ginkgo generate <SUBJECT>

    This will generate a file named `SUBJECT_test.go`.  If you don't specify SUBJECT, it will generate a file named `PACKAGE_test.go` where PACKAGE is the name of the current directory.

By default, these generators will dot-import both Ginkgo and Gomega.  To avoid dot imports, you can pass `--nodot` to both subcommands.  This is discussed more fully in the [next section](#avoiding-dot-imports).

> Note that you don't have to use either of these generators.  They're just convenient helpers to get you up and running quickly.

### Avoiding Dot Imports

Ginkgo and Gomega provide a DSL and, by default, the `ginkgo bootstrap` and `ginkgo generate` commands import both packages into the top-level namespace using dot imports.

There are certain, rare, cases where you need to avoid this.  For example, your code may define methods with names that conflict with the methods defined in Ginkgo and/or Gomega.  In such cases you can either import your code into its own namespace (i.e. drop the `.` in front of your package import).  Or, you can drop the `.` in front of Ginkgo and/or Gomega.  The latter comes at the cost of constantly having to preface your `Describe`s and `It`s with `ginkgo.` and your `Expect`s and `ContainSubstring`s with `gomega.`.

There is a *third* option that the ginkgo CLI provides, however.  If you need to (or simply want to!) avoid dot imports you can:

    ginkgo bootstrap --nodot

and

    ginkgo generate --nodot <filename>

This will create a bootstrap file that *explicitly* imports all the exported identifiers in Ginkgo and Gomega into the top level namespace.  This happens at the bottom of your bootstrap file and generates code that looks something like:

```go
import (
    github.com/onsi/ginkgo
    ...
)

...

// Declarations for Ginkgo DSL
var Describe = ginkgo.Describe
var Context = ginkgo.Context
var It = ginkgo.It
// etc...
```

This allows you to write tests using `Describe`, `Context`, and `It` without dot imports and without the `ginkgo.` prefix.  Crucially, it also allows you to redefine any conflicting identifiers (or even cook up your own semantics!).  For example:

```go
var _ = ginkgo.Describe
var When = ginkgo.Context
var Then = ginkgo.It
```

This will avoid importing `Describe` and will rename `Context` to `When` and `It` to `Then`.

As new matchers are added to Gomega you may need to update the set of imports identifiers.  You can do this by entering the directory containing your bootstrap file and running:

    ginkgo nodot

this will update the imports, preserving any renames that you've provided.

### Converting Existing Tests

If you have an existing XUnit test suite that you'd like to convert to a Ginkgo suite, you can use the `ginkgo convert` command:

    ginkgo convert github.com/your/package

This will generate a Ginkgo bootstrap file and convert any `TestX...(t *testing.T)` XUnit style tsts into simply (flat) Ginkgo tests.  It also substitutes `GinkgoT()` for any references to `*testing.T` in your code.  `ginkgo convert` usually gets things right the first time round, but you may need to go in and tweak your tests after the fact.

Also: `ginkgo convert` will **overwrite** your existing test files, so make sure you don't have any uncommitted changes before trying `ginkgo convert`!

`ginkgo convert` is the brainchild of [Tim Jarratt](http://github.com/tjarratt)

## Benchmark Tests

Ginkgo allows you to measure the performance of your code using `Measure` blocks.   `Measure` blocks can go wherever an `It` block can go -- each `Measure` generates a new spec.  The closure function passed to `Measure` must take a `Benchmarker` argument.  The `Benchmarker` is used to measure runtimes and record arbitrary numerical values.  You must also pass `Measure` an integer after your closure function, this represents the number of samples of your code `Measure` will perform.

For example:

```go
Measure("it should do something hard efficiently", func(b Benchmarker) {
    runtime := b.Time("runtime", func() {
        output := SomethingHard()
        Expect(output).To(Equal(17))
    })

    Ω(runtime.Seconds()).Should(BeNumerically("<", 0.2), "SomethingHard() shouldn't take too long.")

    b.RecordValue("disk usage (in MB)", HowMuchDiskSpaceDidYouUse())
}, 10)
```

will run the closure function 10 times, aggregating data for "runtime" and "disk usage".  Ginkgo's reporter will then print out a summary of each of these metrics containing some simple statistics:

    • [MEASUREMENT]
    Suite
        it should do something hard efficiently

        Ran 10 samples:
        runtime:
          Fastest Time: 0.01s
          Slowest Time: 0.08s
          Average Time: 0.05s ± 0.02s

        disk usage (in MB):
          Smallest: 3.0
           Largest: 5.2
           Average: 3.9 ± 0.4

With `Measure` you can write expressive, exploratory, specs to measure the performance of various parts of your code (or external components, if you use Ginkgo to write integration tests).  As you collect your data, you can leave the `Measure` specs in place to monitor performance and fail the suite should components start growing slow and bloated.

`Measure`s can live alongside `It`s within a test suite.  If you want to run just the `It`s you can pass the `--skipMeasurements` flag to `ginkgo`.

> You can also mark `Measure`s as pending with `PMeasure` and `XMeasure` or focus them with `FMeasure`.

### Measuring Time

The `Benchmarker` passed into your closure function provides the

```go
Time(name string, body func(), info ...Interface{}) time.Duration
```

 method.  `Time` runs the passed in `body` function and records, and returns, its runtime.  The resulting measurements for each sample are aggregated and some simple statistics are computed.  These stats appear in the spec output under the `name` you pass in.  Note that `name` must be unique within the scope of the `Measure` node.

 You can also pass arbitrary information via the optional `info` argument.  This will be passed along to the reporter along with the agreggated runtimes that `Time` measures.  The default reporter presents a string representation of `info`, but you can write a custom reporter to perform something more structured.  For example, you might run several measurements of the same code, but vary some parameter between runs.  You could encode the value of that parameter in `info`, and then have a custom reporter that uses `info` and the statistics provided by Ginkgo to generate a CSV file - or perhaps even a plot.

 If you want to assert that `body` ran within some threshold time, you can make an assertion against `Time`'s return value.

### Recording Arbitrary Values

The `Benchmarker` also provides the

```go
RecordValue(name string, value float64, info ...Interface{})
```

method.  `RecordValue` allows you to record arbitrary numerical data.  These results are aggregated and some simple statistics are computed.  These stats appear in the spec output under the `name` you pass in.  Note that `name` must be unique within the scope of the `Measure` node.

The optional `info` parameter can be used to pass structured data to a custom reporter.  See [Measuring Time](#measuring-time) above for more details.

## Shared Example Patterns

Ginkgo doesn't have any have any explicit support for Shared Examples (also known as Shared Behaviors) but there are a few patterns that you can use to reuse tests across your suite.

### Locally-scoped Shared Behaviors

It is often the case that within a particular suite, there will be a number of different `Context`s that assert the exact same behavior, in that they have identical `It`s within them.  The only difference between these `Context`s is the set up done in their respective `BeforeEach`s.  Rather than repeat the `It`s for these `Context`s, here are two ways to extract the code and avoid repeating yourself.

#### Pattern 1: Extract a function that defines the shared `It`s

Here, we will pull out a function that lives within the same closure that `Context`s live in, that defines the `It`s that are common to those `Context`s.  For example:

```go
Describe("my api client", func() {
    var client APIClient
    var fakeServer FakeServer
    var response chan APIResponse

    BeforeEach(func() {
        response = make(chan APIResponse, 1)
        fakeServer = NewFakeServer()
        client = NewAPIClient(fakeServer)
        client.Get("/some/endpoint", response)
    })

    Describe("failure modes", func() {
        AssertFailedBehavior := func() {
            It("should not include JSON in the response", func() {
                Ω((<-response).JSON).Should(BeZero())
            })

            It("should not report success", func() {
                Ω((<-response).Success).Should(BeFalse())
            })
        }

        Context("when the server does not return a 200", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Respond(404)
            })

            AssertFailedBehavior()
        })

        Context("when the server returns unparseable JSON", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Succeed("{I'm not JSON!")
            })

            AssertFailedBehavior()
        })

        Context("when the request errors", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Error(errors.New("oops!"))
            })

            AssertFailedBehavior()
        })
    })
})
```

Note that the `AssertFailedBehavior` function is called within the body of the `Context` container block.  The `It`s defined by this function get added to the enclosing container.  Since the function shares the same closure scope we don't need to pass the `response` channel in.

You can put as many `It`s as you wanted into the shared behavior `AssertFailedBehavior` above, and can even nest `It`s within `Context`s inside of `AssertFailedBehavior`.  Although it may not always be the best idea to DRY your test suites excessively, this pattern gives you the ability do so as you see fit.  One drawback of this approach, however, is that you cannot focus or pend a shared behavior group, or examples/contexts within the group.  In other words, you don't get `FAssertFailedBehavior` or `XAssertFailedBehavior` for free.

#### Pattern 2: Extract functions that return closures, and pass the results to `It`s

To understand this pattern, let's just redo the above example with this pattern:

```go
Describe("my api client", func() {
    var client APIClient
    var fakeServer FakeServer
    var response chan APIResponse

    BeforeEach(func() {
        response = make(chan APIResponse, 1)
        fakeServer = NewFakeServer()
        client = NewAPIClient(fakeServer)
        client.Get("/some/endpoint", response)
    })

    Describe("failure modes", func() {
        AssertNoJSONInResponse := func() func() {
            return func() {
                Ω((<-response).JSON).Should(BeZero())
            }
        }

        AssertDoesNotReportSuccess := func() func() {
            return func() {
                Ω((<-response).Success).Should(BeFalse())
            }
        }
        Context("when the server does not return a 200", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Respond(404)
            })

            It("should not include JSON in the response", AssertNoJSONInResponse())
            It("should not report success", AssertDoesNotReportSuccess())
        })

        Context("when the server returns unparseable JSON", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Succeed("{I'm not JSON!")
            })

            It("should not include JSON in the response", AssertNoJSONInResponse())
            It("should not report success", AssertDoesNotReportSuccess())
        })

        Context("when the request errors", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Error(errors.New("oops!"))
            })

            It("should not include JSON in the response", AssertNoJSONInResponse())
            It("should not report success", AssertDoesNotReportSuccess())
        })
    })
})
```

Note that this solution is still very compact, especially because there are only two shared `It`s for each `Context`.  There is slightly more repetition here, but it's also slightly more explicit.  The main benefit of this pattern is you can focus and pend individual `It`s in individual `Context`s.

### Global Shared Behaviors

The patterns outlined above work well when the shared behavior is intended to be used within a fixed scope.  If you want to build shared behavior that can be used across different test files (or even different packages) you'll need to tweak the pattern to make it possible to pass inputs in.  We can extend both examples outlined above to illustrate how this might work:

#### Pattern 1

```go
package sharedbehaviors

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

type FailedResponseBehaviorInputs struct {
    response chan APIResponse
}

func SharedFailedResponseBehavior(inputs *FailedResponseBehaviorInputs) {
    It("should not include JSON in the response", func() {
        Ω((<-(inputs.response)).JSON).Should(BeZero())
    })

    It("should not report success", func() {
        Ω((<-(inputs.response)).Success).Should(BeFalse())
    })
}
```

#### Pattern 2

```go
package sharedbehaviors

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

type FailedResponseBehaviorInputs struct {
    response chan APIResponse
}

func AssertNoJSONInResponese(inputs *FailedResponseBehaviorInputs) func() {
    return func() {
        Ω((<-(inputs.response)).JSON).Should(BeZero())
    }
}

func AssertDoesNotReportSuccess(inputs *FailedResponseBehaviorInputs) func() {
    return func() {
        Ω((<-(inputs.response)).Success).Should(BeFalse())
    }
}
```

Users of the shared behavior must generate and populate a `FailedResponseBehaviorInputs` and pass it in to either `SharedFailedResponseBehavior` or `AssertNoJSONInResponese` and `AssertDoesNotReportSuccess`.  Why do things this way?  Two reasons:

1. Having a stuct to encapsulate the input variables (like `FailedResponseBehaviorInputs`) allows you to clearly stipulate the contract between the the specs and the shared behavior.  The shared behavior *needs* these inputs in order to function correctly.

2. More importantly, inputs like the `response` channel are generally created and/or set in `BeforeEach` blocks.  However the shared behavior functions must be called within a container block and will not have access to any variables specified in a `BeforeEach` as the `BeforeEach` hasn't run yet.  To get around this, we instantiate a `FailedResponseBehaviorInputs` and pass a pointer to it to the shared behavior functions -- in the `BeforeEach` we manipulate the fields of the `FailedResponseBehaviorInputs`, ensuring that their values get communicated to the `It`s generated by the shared behavior.

Here's what the calling test would look like after dot-importing the `sharedbehaviors` package (for brevity we'll combine patterns 1 and 2 in this example):

```go
Describe("my api client", func() {
    var client APIClient
    var fakeServer FakeServer
    var response chan APIResponse
    sharedInputs := FailedResponseBehaviorInputs{}

    BeforeEach(func() {
        sharedInputs.response = make(chan APIResponse, 1)
        fakeServer = NewFakeServer()
        client = NewAPIClient(fakeServer)
        client.Get("/some/endpoint", sharedInputs.response)
    })

    Describe("failure modes", func() {
        Context("when the server does not return a 200", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Respond(404)
            })

            // Pattern 1
            SharedFailedResponseBehavior(&sharedInputs)
        })

        Context("when the server returns unparseable JSON", func() {
            BeforeEach(func() {
                fakeServer.Succeed("{I'm not JSON!")
            })

            // Pattern 2
            It("should not include JSON in the response", AssertNoJSONInResponse(&sharedInputs))
            It("should not report success", AssertDoesNotReportSuccess(&sharedInputs))
        })
    })
})
```

## Ginkgo and Continuous Integration

Ginkgo comes with a number of [flags](#running-tests) that you probably want to turn on when running in a Continuous Integration environment.  The following is recommended:

    ginkgo -r --randomizeAllSpecs --randomizeSuites --failOnPending --cover --trace --race --progress

- `-r` will recursively find and run all spec suites in the current directory
- `--randomizeAllSpecs` and `--randomizeSuites` will shuffle both the order in which specs within a suite run, and the order in which different suites run.  This can be *great* for identifying test pollution.  You can always rerun a given ordering later by passing the `--seed` flag a matching seed.
- `--failOnPending` causes the test suite to fail if there are any pending tests (typically these should not be committed but should signify work in progress).
- `--cover` generates `.coverprofile`s and coverage statistics for each test suite.
- `--trace` prints out a full stack trace when failures occur.  This makes debugging based on CI logs easier.
- `--race` runs the tests with the race detector turned on.
- `--progress` emits test progress to the GinkgoWriter.  Makes identifying where failures occur a little easier.

It is *not* recommended that you run tests in parallel on CI with `-p`.  Many CI systems run on multi-core machines that report very many (e.g. 32 nodes).  Parallelizing on such a high scale typically yields *longer* test run times (particularly since your tests are probably running inside some sort of cpu-share limited container: you don't actually have free reign of all 32 cores).  To run tests in parallel on CI you're probably better off providing an explicit number of parallel nodes with `-nodes`.

### Sample .travis.yml

For Travis CI, you could use something like this:

    language: go
    go:
        - 1.9
        - tip

    install:
        - go get -v github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
        - go get -v github.com/onsi/gomega
        - go get -v -t ./...
        - export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/gopath/bin

    script: ginkgo -r --randomizeAllSpecs --randomizeSuites --failOnPending --cover --trace --race --compilers=2

Note that we've added `--compilers=2` -- this resolves an issue where Travis kills the Ginkgo process early for being too greedy.  By default, Ginkgo will run `runtime.NumCPU()` compilers which, on Travis, can be as many as `32` compilers!  Similarly, if you want to run your tests in parallel on Travis, make sure to specify `--nodes=N` instead of `-p`.

---

## Extensions

Ginkgo ships with extensions to the core DSL.  These can be (optionally) dot imported to augment Ginkgo's default DSL.

Currently there is only one extension: the table extension.

### Table Driven Tests

The [table](https://godoc.org/github.com/onsi/ginkgo/extensions/table) provides an expressive DSL for writing table driven tests.

| Attention: if you have ginkgo in your `vendor` directory, be sure to add the package `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/extensions/table` to `vendor`. See [issue 234](https://github.com/onsi/ginkgo/issues/234#issuecomment-196645747) for details. |
| :-------------------- |

While it's easy to roll your own table driven tests using simple data structures and a for loop, this layer of DSL makes it particularly easy to write and manage table driven tests.

For example:

```go
package table_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/extensions/table"

    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

var _ = Describe("Math", func() {
    DescribeTable("the > inequality",
        func(x int, y int, expected bool) {
            Expect(x > y).To(Equal(expected))
        },
        Entry("x > y", 1, 0, true),
        Entry("x == y", 0, 0, false),
        Entry("x < y", 0, 1, false),
    )
})
```

> In this example we dot import the table extension.  This isn't strictly necessary but makes the DSL easier to interact with.

Let's break this down `DescribeTable` takes a description, a function to run for each test case, and a set of table entries.

The function you pass in to `DescribeTable` can accept arbitrary arguments.  The parameters passed in to the individual `Entry` calls will be passed in to the function (type mismatches will result in a runtime panic).

The indiviudal `Entry` calls construct a `TableEntry` that is passed into `DescribeTable`.  A `TableEntry` consists of a description (the first call to `Entry`) and an arbitrary set of parameters to be passed into the function registered with `DescribeTable`.

It's important to understand the life-cycle of the table.  The `table` package is a thin wrapper around Ginkgo's DSL.  `DescribeTable` generates a single Ginkgo `Describe`, within this `Describe` each `Entry` generates a Ginkgo `It`.  This all happens *before* the tests run (at "testing tree construction time").  The result is that the table expands into a number of `It`s (one for each `Entry`) that are subject to all of Ginkgo's test-running semantics: `It`s can be randomized and parallelized across multiple nodes.

To be clear, the above test is *exactly* equivalent to:

```go
package table_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

var _ = Describe("Math", func() {
    Describe("the > inequality",
        It("x > y", func() {
            Expect(1 > 0).To(Equal(true))
        })

        It("x == y", func() {
            Expect(0 > 0).To(Equal(false))
        })

        It("x < y", func() {
            Expect(0 > 1).To(Equal(false))
        })
    )
})
```

#### Focusing and Pending Tables and Entries

Here's the cool part.  Entire tables can be focused or marked pending by simply swapping out `DescribeTable` with `FDescribeTable` (to focus) or `PDescribeTable` (to mark pending).

Similarly, individual entries can be focused/pended out with `FEntry` and `PEntry`.  This is particularly useful when debugging tests.

#### Managing Complex Parameters

While passing arbitrary parameters to `Entry` is convenient it can make the test cases difficult to parse at a glance.  For more complex tables it may make more sense to define a new type and pass it around instead.  For example:

```go
package table_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/extensions/table"

    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"
)

var _ = Describe("Substring matching", func() {
    type SubstringCase struct {
        String    string
        Substring string
        Count     int
    }

    DescribeTable("counting substring matches",
        func(c SubstringCase) {
            Ω(strings.Count(c.String, c.Substring)).Should(BeNumerically("==", c.Count))
        },
        Entry("with no matching substring", SubstringCase{
            String:    "the sixth sheikh's sixth sheep's sick",
            Substring: "emir",
            Count:     0,
        }),
        Entry("with one matching substring", SubstringCase{
            String:    "the sixth sheikh's sixth sheep's sick",
            Substring: "sheep",
            Count:     1,
        }),
        Entry("with many matching substring", SubstringCase{
            String:    "the sixth sheikh's sixth sheep's sick",
            Substring: "si",
            Count:     3,
        }),
    )
})
```

Note that this pattern uses the same DSL, it's simply a way to manage the parameters flowing between the `Entry` cases and the callback registered with `DescribeTable`.

---

## Writing Custom Reporters

While Ginkgo's default reporter offers a comprehensive set of features, Ginkgo makes it easy to write and run multiple custom reporters at once.  There are many usecases for this - you might implement a custom reporter to support a special output format for your CI setup, or you might implement a custom reporter to [aggregate data](#measuring-time) from Ginkgo's `Measure` nodes and produce HTML or CSV reports (or even plots!)

In Ginkgo a reporter must satisfy the `Reporter` interface:

```go
type Reporter interface {
    SpecSuiteWillBegin(config config.GinkgoConfigType, summary *types.SuiteSummary)
    BeforeSuiteDidRun(setupSummary *types.SetupSummary)
    SpecWillRun(specSummary *types.SpecSummary)
    SpecDidComplete(specSummary *types.SpecSummary)
    AfterSuiteDidRun(setupSummary *types.SetupSummary)
    SpecSuiteDidEnd(summary *types.SuiteSummary)
}
```

The method names should be self-explanatory.  Be sure to dig into the `SuiteSummary` and `SpecSummary` objects to get a sense of what data is available to your reporter.  If you're writing a custom reporter to ingest benchmarking data generated by `Measure` nodes you'll want to look at the `ExampleMeasurement` struct that is provided by `ExampleSummary.Measurements`.

Once you've created your custom reporter you may pass an instance of it to Ginkgo by replacing the `RunSpecs` command in your test suite bootstrap with either:

```go
RunSpecsWithDefaultAndCustomReporters(t *testing.T, description string, reporters []Reporter)
```

or

```go
RunSpecsWithCustomReporters(t *testing.T, description string, reporters []Reporter)
```

`RunSpecsWithDefaultAndCustomReporters` will run your custom reporters alongside Ginkgo's default reporter.  `RunSpecsWithCustomReporters` will only run the custom reporters you pass in.

If you wish to run your tests in parallel you should not use `RunSpecsWithCustomReporters` as the default reporter plays an important role in streaming test output to the ginkgo CLI.

---

## Third Party Integrations

### Using Other Matcher Libraries

Most matcher library accept the `*testing.T` object.  Unfortunately, since this is a concrete type is can be tricky to pass in an equivalent that will work with Ginkgo.

It is, typically, not difficult to replace `*testing.T` in such libraries with an interface that `*testing.T` satisfies.  For example [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) accepts `t` via an interface.  In such cases you can pass `GinkgoT()`.  This generates an object that mimics `*testing.T` and communicates to Ginkgo directly.

For example, to get testify working:

```go
package foo_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"

    "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
)

var _ = Describe(func("foo") {
    It("should testify to its correctness", func(){
        assert.Equal(GinkgoT(), foo{}.Name(), "foo")
    })
})
```

> Note that passing the `*testing.T` from Ginkgo's bootstrap `Test...()` function will cause the suite to abort as soon as the first failure is encountered.  Don't do this.  You need to communicate failure to Ginkgo's single (global) `Fail` function

### Integrating with Gomock

Ginkgo does not provide a mocking/stubbing framework.  It's the author's opinion that mocks and stubs can be avoided completely by embracing dependency injection and always injecting Go interfaces.  Real dependencies are then injected in production code, and fake dependencies are injected under test.  Building and maintaining such fakes tends to be straightforward and can allow for clearer and more expressive tests than mocks.

With that said, it is relatively straightforward to use a mocking framework such as [Gomock](https://code.google.com/p/gomock/).  `GinkgoT()` implements Gomock's `TestReporter` interface.  Here's how you use it (for example):

```go
import (
    "code.google.com/p/gomock/gomock"

    . github.com/onsi/ginkgo
    . github.com/onsi/gomega
)

var _ = Describe("Consumer", func() {
    var (
        mockCtrl *gomock.Controller
        mockThing *mockthing.MockThing
        consumer *Consumer
    )

    BeforeEach(func() {
        mockCtrl = gomock.NewController(GinkgoT())
        mockThing = mockthing.NewMockThing(mockCtrl)
        consumer = NewConsumer(mockThing)
    })

    AfterEach(func() {
        mockCtrl.Finish()
    })

    It("should consume things", func() {
        mockThing.EXPECT().OmNom()
        consumer.Consume()
    })
})
```

When using Gomock you may want to run `ginkgo` with the `-trace` flag to print out stack traces for failures which will help you trace down where, in your code, invalid calls occured.

### Generating JUnit XML Output

Ginkgo provides a [custom reporter](#writing-custom-reporters) for generating JUnit compatible XML output.  Here's a sample bootstrap file that instantiates a JUnit reporter and passes it to the test runner:

```go
package foo_test

import (
    . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo"
    . "github.com/onsi/gomega"

    "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/reporters"
    "testing"
)

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
    RegisterFailHandler(Fail)
    junitReporter := reporters.NewJUnitReporter("junit.xml")
    RunSpecsWithDefaultAndCustomReporters(t, "Foo Suite", []Reporter{junitReporter})
}
```

This will generate a file name "junit.xml" in the directory containing your test.  This xml file is compatible with the latest version of the Jenkins JUnit plugin.

If you want to run your tests in parallel you'll need to make your JUnit xml filename a function of the parallel node number.  You can do this like so:

    junitReporter := reporters.NewJUnitReporter(fmt.Sprintf("junit_%d.xml", config.GinkgoConfig.ParallelNode))

Note that you'll need to import `fmt` and `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/config` to get this to work.  This will generate an xml file for each parallel node.  The Jenkins JUnit plugin (for example) automatically aggregates data from across all these files.

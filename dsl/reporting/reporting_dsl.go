/*
Ginkgo is usually dot-imported via:

    import . "github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2"

however some parts of the DSL may conflict with existing symbols in the user's code.

To mitigate this without losing the brevity of dot-importing Ginkgo the various packages in the
dsl directory provide pieces of the Ginkgo DSL that can be dot-imported separately.

This "reporting" package pulls in the reporting-related pieces of the Ginkgo DSL.
